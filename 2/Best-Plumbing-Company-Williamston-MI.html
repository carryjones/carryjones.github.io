When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If permitted to return to the supply of water, there is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk.

Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
