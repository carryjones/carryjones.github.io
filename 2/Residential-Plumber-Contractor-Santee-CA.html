<p>In general, toilets are pretty simple to repair and operate. Nearly any part can be removed and replaced fairly quickly and rapidly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has an issue, the stakes are high. Damaged toilets can do some really comprehensive, costly, and ... stinky damage to a home. When something goes wrong, and your kitchen sink draws back up, your toilet won't flush, or you can't take a shower, you need for professional support immediately. That's where High 5 Plumbing comes in. With years of market experience, we understand how to tackle a variety of drain problems.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
