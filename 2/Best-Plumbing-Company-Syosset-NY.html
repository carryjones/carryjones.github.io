<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is normal in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system.

Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
