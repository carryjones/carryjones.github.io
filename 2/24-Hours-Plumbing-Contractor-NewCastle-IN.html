<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>By replacing the rusted and rusted galvanized metal pipe with new copper pipes, your home will have cleaner and better-tasting water. Repiping likewise guarantees that water pressure is higher.
