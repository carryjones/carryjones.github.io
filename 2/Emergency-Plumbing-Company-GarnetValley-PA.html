After they provided me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
