The salt water solution must be combined and stored in the brine tank. Periodic blocking of the resin also needs special attention. For instance, if the raw water system is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Likewise, fungi and bacteria also form mats in the resin that minimize its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these annoyances.
