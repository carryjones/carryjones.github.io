Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
