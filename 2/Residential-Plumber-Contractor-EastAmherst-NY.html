<p>In many cases, our service technicians will advise that you replace your hot water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is usually When the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would amount to more than half the cost of an entire new unit, the case. Sometimes a troublesome toilet just requires a small change and life is back to typical. That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a dye test.</p>

This article is also for you if yours is getting old. Replacing a water heater isn't tough if you're handy with fundamental tools and have a little experience soldering copper.</p>
<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this short article about liners. I discover that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are saying. Because they do not like the innovation and not because it does not work, will likewise state something doesn't work well just. The piping process adds to the installation costs if this heater is set up in a house with numerous bathrooms.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more considerable expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for locals. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist determine.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear area shall be kept above the assembly to allow for servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves.

Our professionally-trained, background-checked, and licensed plumbers will gladly answer any concerns you have about your house's plumbing system.</p>
