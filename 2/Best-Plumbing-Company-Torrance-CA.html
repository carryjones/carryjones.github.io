<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less crucial things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>Installation and replacement costs are often similar, though replacement normally will not need additional charges, such as application charges. New meters need to satisfy policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers may need a distinct meter for their services, limiting your choices. Layout - Once you add a 2nd floor and even third floor, pipes need to be added to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will use more products which adds to your labor costs.</p>
