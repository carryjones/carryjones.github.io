<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.

For this reason, the RPZ ought to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
