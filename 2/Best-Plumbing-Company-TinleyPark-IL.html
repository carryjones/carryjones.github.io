<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
