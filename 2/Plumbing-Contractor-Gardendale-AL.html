<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
