Due the potential to possible for backflow to cause illness, injury or even death, the Uniform Plumbing Code considers landscape watering systems to be high hazard, however by setting up authorized backflow prevention devices at cross-connections you can avoid backflow and secure your irrigation clients and neighborhood.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water, backpressure is developed. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then get in the potable water system. The very best method to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>
