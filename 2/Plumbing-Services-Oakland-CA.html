Local building regulations for instance will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, preventing contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complicated and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the relatively basic to the complex and extremely advanced.</p>
