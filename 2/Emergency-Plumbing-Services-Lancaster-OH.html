For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, however in time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
