However, lots of water softeners regrow frequently, when the filter medium actually isn't full. This can be remedied by just resetting your water softener to get rid of less solidity or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>

The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.
