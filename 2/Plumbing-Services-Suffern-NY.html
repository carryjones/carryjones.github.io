<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
