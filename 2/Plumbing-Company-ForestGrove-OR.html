<p>106.2.1 Fixing Leaks.

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
