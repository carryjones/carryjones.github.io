<p>Incorrect drainage slope: Drainage pipes are developed to take drainage away from a house and provide it to the city's sewer system. Most do this utilizing the power of gravity; pipes are sloped to drain water towards the street.

The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon prior to it can take place, preventing infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complex backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the relatively easy to the complex and really advanced.</p>
