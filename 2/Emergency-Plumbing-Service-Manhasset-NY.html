<p>Surprise water leakages are frequently difficult and have Potentially Severe Repercussions. Changing your flapper may need a little different actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
