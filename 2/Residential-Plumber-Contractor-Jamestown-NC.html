<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just tough to spot, they're also capable of triggering some serious damage. Pinhole leaks, for instance, are so small that they only launch a number of beads at a time. That's far too small to trigger a drop in water pressure, or any of the other signs that might warn of a leak in the system.
