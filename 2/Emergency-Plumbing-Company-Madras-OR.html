<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
