<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
