Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, totally free" sodium ions are launched into the water.

<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases during the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak right now and often those leaks come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
