<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>To make sure that the repair process succeeded, it is now time to switch on the gas and check for leakages. Repeat the procedure of sealing the leakages till you are satisfied that there are no more gas leaks if there are any leaks.
