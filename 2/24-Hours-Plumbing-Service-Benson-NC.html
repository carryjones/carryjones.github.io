<p>Worn-out pipes when you need to replace old. Repiping a home can take from a few hours for a simplified small pipe repair or replacement, or it can use up to a week for larger houses requiring the entire plumbing system repiped.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
