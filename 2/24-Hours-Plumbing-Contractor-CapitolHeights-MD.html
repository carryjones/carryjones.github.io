I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
