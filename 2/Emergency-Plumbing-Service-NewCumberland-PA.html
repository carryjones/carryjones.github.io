<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints.

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be effectively re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
