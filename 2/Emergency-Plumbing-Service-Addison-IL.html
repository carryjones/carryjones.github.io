<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hang on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by hanging on to the weaker charged salt ions. As hard water passes through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet.

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, in addition to checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
