<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
