<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles went down the freshly cleaned main drain. By adding perseverence and perseverance the task was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
