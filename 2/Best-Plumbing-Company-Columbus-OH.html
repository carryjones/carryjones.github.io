When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion.

Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released.
