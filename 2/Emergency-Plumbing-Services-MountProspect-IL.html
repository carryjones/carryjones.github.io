<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
