<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Selma CA!</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually preserved at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Serious rust, or rusty water, could mean the tank will need to be changed. As water heater age, sediment accumulation and corrodes the inside of the tank and rust can establish enabling it into the main supply of water.

That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
