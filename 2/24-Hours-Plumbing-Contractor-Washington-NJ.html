<p>Backflow valves not just protect you versus contaminates but also your next-door neighbors who count on the very same water supply system. A water softener gathers hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are typically used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is looked for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as sodium or potassium.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
