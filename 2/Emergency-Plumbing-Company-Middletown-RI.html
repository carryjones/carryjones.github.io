Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
