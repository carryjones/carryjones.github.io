<p>When you have a clogged piping system in your Miami, Florida facilities, you can either pick a plumber who digs up your backyard, excavates the walls and destroy the foundation throughout the pipe repairs, or you can have the insight to work with a professional such as Eco 1 Plumbing.

<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the glory in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge in between man and machine.

And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity though, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those little daily troubles - that most people just deal with and never ever realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water lost every day by a poor seal.</p>
