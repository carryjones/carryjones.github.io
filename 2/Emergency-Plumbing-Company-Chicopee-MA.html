Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
