<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of elements that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control. Thus, thinking about all these aspects, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
