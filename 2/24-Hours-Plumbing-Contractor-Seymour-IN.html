Get rid of excess plumber's putty.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are harmless, but gradually they develop and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
