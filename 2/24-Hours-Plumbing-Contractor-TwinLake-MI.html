<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous elements that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of rust control. Hence, thinking about all these elements, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
