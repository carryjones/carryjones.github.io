<p>. Backflow into a public water system can pollute the water or contaminate in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water because system unsafe or unusable to drink), and each water supplier has a duty to provide water that is functional and safe to drink under all foreseeable scenarios. Moreover, consumers normally have outright faith that water delivered to them through a public water supply is constantly safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district need to take safety measures to protect its public water system against backflow.</p>

<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire fighting or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction result and draw possible contaminants into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are frequently discovered in the majority of homes. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the leading to deliver hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to the City of Bellingham.
