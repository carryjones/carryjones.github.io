<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
