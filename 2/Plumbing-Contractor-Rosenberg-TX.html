<p>Because of the fundamental design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an exceptionally low circulation or fixed flow condition may cause nuisance dripping and potential fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
<p>There are a number of indicators that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is very important to focus on them. The gas pipe may be pierced or harmed if you notice a strong smell that looks like rotten eggs. You may also hear a hissing sound as the gas is escaping from the line, but that isn't always the case. If you smell rotten eggs, it is essential to act rapidly to prevent any severe problems and to keep everybody safe.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear space will be preserved above the assembly to permit servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves. As quickly as you believe a problem with your sewer or water lines, call a plumber. An obstruction or a break can lead to damages that are costly to repair so time is of the essence. Our professionally-trained, background-checked, and licensed plumbers will happily respond to any concerns you have about your home's plumbing system.</p>
