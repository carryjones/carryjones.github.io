<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
