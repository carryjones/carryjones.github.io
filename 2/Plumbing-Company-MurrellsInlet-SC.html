<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In MurrellsInlet SC</h3>
<p>Plumbing and piping technology has improved over the last thirty years. Copper has been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which utilized to be thought about really strong, however they were discovered to split under pressure and tend to corrode within a couple of years). Today, many quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were timely and very responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did an amazing task. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
