<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
<p>While a few of these items appear harmless enough, they can all add to harming the grinding mechanism or jamming the disposal and obstructing.
