The most common washers are frequently available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up properly, you might experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
