<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
