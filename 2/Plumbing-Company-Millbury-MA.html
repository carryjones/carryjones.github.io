<p>Gas is an affordable and clean-burning method to running home appliances and heating homes.

<p>The drains in the average home get continuous usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other particles can slowly develop with time.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
