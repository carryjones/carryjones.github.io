When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health threat.
