Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.

These pipes are mainly in production, commercial, and industrial settings. Fitters repair and install pipe systems in power plants, as well as heating and cooling systems in large office buildings. Steamfitters concentrate on systems that are developed for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
