<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
