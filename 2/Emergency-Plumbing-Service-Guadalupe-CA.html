<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. Over time, like any other appliance in your house, your waste disposal unit. may require repairs. A disposal system may start or clog to leak through heavy, or incorrect, usage. A leak someplace in the system may suggest a used seal.
