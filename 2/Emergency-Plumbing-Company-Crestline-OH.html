<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
