<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
