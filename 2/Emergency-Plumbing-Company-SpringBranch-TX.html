<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium.

While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its lots of designated usages around your home.</p>

As the outer finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
