That slow, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and rust.
