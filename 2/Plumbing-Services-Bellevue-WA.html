While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>

For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure.
