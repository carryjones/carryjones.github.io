<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Windham NH</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be required to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both places. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
