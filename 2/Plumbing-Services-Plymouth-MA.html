Channeling takes place when the incoming difficult water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you have actually ever discovered that the busier your business is, the better your detergent works, the culprit could be an extra-large softener.</p>

For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.

Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.

We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
