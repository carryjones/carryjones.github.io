Channeling takes place when the incoming difficult water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you have actually ever discovered that the busier your business is, the better your detergent works, the culprit could be an extra-large softener.</p>

Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.

We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
