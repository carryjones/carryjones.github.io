Fire security system are designed to match the risk that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and set up to satisfy that specific hazard or need. An aircraft garage will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system required in an apartment.
