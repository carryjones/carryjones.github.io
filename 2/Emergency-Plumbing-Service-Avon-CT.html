<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Avon CT</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>To identify if your house is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can likewise be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water main. Ensure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
