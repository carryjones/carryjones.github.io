<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
