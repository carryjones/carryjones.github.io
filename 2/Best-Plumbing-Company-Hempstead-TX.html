Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>

When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
