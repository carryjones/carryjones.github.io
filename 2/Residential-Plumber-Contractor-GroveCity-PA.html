<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain properly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. Often drain repair needs can be resolved relatively rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be dismantled, analyzed, and cleared prior to being replaced. In many cases, a handyman may identify that a replacement part is essential (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to ensure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to go over repair alternatives.</p>

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>

<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might take place. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly protected, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Gas lines are essential for households: they power stoves, hot water heater, and other devices to keep you dry, warm, and comfortable all year long. Nevertheless, your gas line also carries naturally unpredictable components that can be harmful if not dealt with properly. Time and utilize rust gas lines, making them more susceptible to cracks and breaks. At American Leak Detection, our knowledgeable team of gas leak experts have extensive training and accreditation to locate and repair gas leaks.</p>
