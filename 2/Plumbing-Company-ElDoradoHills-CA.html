<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water home appliances?

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping).

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
