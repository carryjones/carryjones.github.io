<p>The toilet takes an actually long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- described as the zone of minimized pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to release and open water to the outside, ensuring backflow never happens.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more considerable expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for citizens. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
