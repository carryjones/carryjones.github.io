<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in various parts of the plumbing system, many commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow concerns or even stop a fixture from flowing entirely. The next common issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so extreme that it minimizes the offered volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items consisting of extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
