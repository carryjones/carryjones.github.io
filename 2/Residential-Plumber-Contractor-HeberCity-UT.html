<p>While numerous water heater problems can be effectively fixed, some issues will necessitate total water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its normal life expectancy (normally anywhere from 8 to 10 years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a major leak or extensive rust, it might be time to think about replacement.</p>
<p>Typical repairs do not fix the issue. It's most likely a concern you can't fix without professional aid if it appears you're constantly experiencing plumbing problems. A licensed plumber can not only spot that cause of the problem however safely repair or replace your main sewer line if needed. If you're afraid that a repiping task implies that plumbers will remove your drywall and floorboards, turning your home into a demolition zone, you don't need to fret. Repiping is a large job, but Jarboe's Heating, plumbing & cooling can handle it in such a way to decrease the invasive work done on the structure material of your home.</p>
<p>A minimum of once every three months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining pipes a gallon approximately helps eliminate the sediment.

To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your whole house when you identify a leak.</p>
