<p>Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Because soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum, the reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" came from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>
<p>Porcelain and stainless steel sinks can last anywhere from 15 to thirty years, with porcelain sinks lasting 30 years or longer. Porcelain sinks with cast-iron cores can last the longest, and lots of porcelain sinks can be refinished several times. Yes, certified and licensed plumbers can make installation and repair modifications to the gas piping system.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
