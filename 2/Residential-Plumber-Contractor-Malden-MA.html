<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.
