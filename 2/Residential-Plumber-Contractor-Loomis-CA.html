<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage takes place when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water supply into the public water system. This can occur at any time, such as throughout a water main break or throughout a large firefighting effort.</p>
<p>The average plumber's hourly wage is $68-$ 138. Many times basic repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a repaired cost of about $220 unless there are extenuating scenarios. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a fee to look at your scenario and inform you what needs to be done, but if you employ them, that charge will be deducted from the costs. A plumber might charge $50-$ 100 to identify the issue and come. 2 Having to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a holiday will cost more.</p>
