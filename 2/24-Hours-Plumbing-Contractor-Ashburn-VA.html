<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized assessments consist of specialized camera equipment that runs into your sewer line.

Master plumber licenses are granted to plumbers who have held a journey license for a certain amount of time, and have built up the needed hours working as a licensed journey plumber. In addition, a master plumber likewise has to pass a state sanctioned test.</p>
