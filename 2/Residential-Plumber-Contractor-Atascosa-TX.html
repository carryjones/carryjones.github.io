<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of factors, including poor soil conditions, obstructions from grease and gunk, and deterioration. Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, specifically in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as intensified if pipes have actually been permitted to freeze.</p>
