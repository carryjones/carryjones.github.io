Blanc also built a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
