<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
