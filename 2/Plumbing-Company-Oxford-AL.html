<p>House owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is specifically sensible to arrange inspections on a yearly basis and when purchasing a new home.

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to business? The timing of regrowth depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water really needs it. Newer systems utilize digital sensors that monitor bead deficiency and other essential metrics based upon your water usage and therefore just restore when required.
