<p>If these combinations aren't successful in unclogging your sink, grab a common household plunger. First seal off the second side with a wet fabric or a stopper if you have a double sink. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you mean to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger securely over the drain and plunge vigorously a number of times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, eliminate the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. A few of those thin spots leak right now and sometimes those leaks come weeks or days later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up requiring to be effectively re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
