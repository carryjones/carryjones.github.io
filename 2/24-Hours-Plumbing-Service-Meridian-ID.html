I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
