Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water actually requires it. Newer systems use electronic sensing units that monitor bead depletion and other crucial metrics based upon your water use and therefore just restore when required.
