Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most devastating and common water problems: difficult water.  Tough water ruined the modern-day home. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice makers. Difficult water damages hot water devices. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
