<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was regularly clogging. They came out and dug a brand-new route for the line connected it to the sewer and everything. It was extremely hot and I truly appreciate their effort to permit us to use our water centers again. Had a great experience with these folks. I highly advise their services.</p>
<p>Sound is regular, however when you notice that the sounds are all there however food is not being ground up it is likely that the motor has gone. Some noises show the need for repairs or a great clear out, and you can give the system a good check before beginning to price brand-new ones. But if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you cash for really little future usage.</p>
