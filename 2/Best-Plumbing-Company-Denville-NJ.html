No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more often than you think! Typically it happens at night when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
