<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it is necessary to understand the common reasons for gas leakages. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning appliances happen most frequently in the winter.

Hanging on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
