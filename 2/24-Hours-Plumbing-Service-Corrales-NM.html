<p>Except for domestic pump and pump and irrigation systems, accreditation is not required to install plumbing systems beyond a building (e.g., water lines connected directly to community water pipe, sewer line connections, and so on). For exceptional quality repiping services in your area, trust the group that puts their customers initially. Are you dealing with a drain issue? Contact our Santa Fe drain cleaning specialists to schedule a consultation today.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
