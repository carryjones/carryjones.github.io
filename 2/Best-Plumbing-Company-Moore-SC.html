Within the building envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a sub-system, system, or component  group is replaced, a license and inspection will not be needed.

As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
