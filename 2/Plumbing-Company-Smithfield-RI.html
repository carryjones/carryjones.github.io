<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
