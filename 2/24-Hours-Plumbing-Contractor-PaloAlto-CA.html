<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire fighting or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can create a suction effect and draw prospective impurities into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are frequently found in the majority of homes. Their elements are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water until it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive alternative.</p>
