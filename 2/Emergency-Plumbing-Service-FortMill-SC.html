Within the building envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a component, sub-system, or system group is replaced, an authorization and inspection shall not be needed.

Nevertheless, in an appropriately working toilet, the water should stop running once the bowl is filled to its proper capacity. If your toilet continues to run, possibilities are you have an internal leak and water is being dumped down the overflow. These leaks are extremely inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
