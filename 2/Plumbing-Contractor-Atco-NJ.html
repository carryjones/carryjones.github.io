<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition defense. As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
