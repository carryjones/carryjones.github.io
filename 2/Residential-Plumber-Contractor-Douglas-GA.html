Liquified calcium and magnesium speed up out of tough water as scale, which builds up on the insides of pipes, hot water heater, tea kettles, coffee machine and commercial equipment. Scale minimizes circulation through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Ultimately, pipes can end up being completely clogged.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
