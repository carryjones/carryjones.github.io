<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. A permit is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions supplied alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>

<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket.

A number of homes in my area being repiped and have actually spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can trigger significant damage if the leak isn't discovered soon.</p>
