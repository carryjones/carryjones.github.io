<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
