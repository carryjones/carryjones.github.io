<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
