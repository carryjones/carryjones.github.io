In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to remove little sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending upon the size of your home, this procedure will likely take a couple of days to a week to complete. Don't fret, while we're working on your house we'll cover all of your furniture, floors and other possessions so that our work does not make a mess. After the entire procedure is finished and your house is cleaned up, we'll test to ensure that water is flowing properly through all of your brand-new pipes.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Image 1. If additional pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise, water is most likely leaving through a broken or corroded overflow tube. In that case, you have to remove the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Given that the overflow tube is rarely the cause of a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>
