<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Typically, this is because the system is dated or not working effectively. Whatever the factor, you can be missing out on the advantages of soft water without even knowing it.</p>

Used impellers on older disposals can become inefficient, increasing the threat of drain obstructions.</p>
