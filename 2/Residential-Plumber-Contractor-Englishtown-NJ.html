<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up effectively, you may experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
