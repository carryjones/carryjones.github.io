<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
