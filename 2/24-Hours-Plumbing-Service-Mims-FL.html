<h3>Broken Pipe in Mims Florida</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.
