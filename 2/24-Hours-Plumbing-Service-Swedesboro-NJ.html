It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and local sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
