<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange.

When a brand-new home is developed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code.
