To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, however opportunities are you'll find among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
