<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>To avoid these things from blocking your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons advises that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your home. These cool additions to your tubs and sinks can reduce the amount of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drainpipes.
