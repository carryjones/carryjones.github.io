<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow.
