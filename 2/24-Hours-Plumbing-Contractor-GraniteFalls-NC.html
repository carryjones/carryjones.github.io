<h3>Why Plumbers Should Install Water Heaters in GraniteFalls NC?</h3>
<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are many elements that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of deterioration control. Hence, considering all these elements, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
