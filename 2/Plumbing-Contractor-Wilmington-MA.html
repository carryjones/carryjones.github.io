And who wishes to do all that work???

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in areas where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
