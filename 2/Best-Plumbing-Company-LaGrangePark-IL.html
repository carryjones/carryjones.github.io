<p>SofTap's water softening technology is appropriate for household, commercial, and industrial applications, including the prevention of limescale build-up in homes and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, in addition to improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is simpler and more cost-efficient than other softening systems on the marketplace today that use zeolites, which need to be regrowed utilizing brine, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water usage and high pressure.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass constructed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some kind of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's smart to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the system.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to a zero need condition (no valves open downstream). However, particles in between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way. This enables pressure to match between the Supply Side and the Zone of Reduced Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
