<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Ventura CA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
