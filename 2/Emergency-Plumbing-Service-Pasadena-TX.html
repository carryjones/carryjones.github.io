<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to eliminate the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and lots of other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and watering, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>

<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning appliances happen most commonly in the winter.
