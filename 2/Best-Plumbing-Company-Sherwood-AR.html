A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly.

If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
