<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see however hardly ever stop to consider. 106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exemptions in Area 106.2.2 shall be applicable to minor repairs and replacement piping only. In structures aside from Group R-3 tenancies, an authorization and inspection will be required for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor area, wing, or level is involved, even though the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (nominal) of the overall building plumbing.</p>
