<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
