<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If enabled to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
