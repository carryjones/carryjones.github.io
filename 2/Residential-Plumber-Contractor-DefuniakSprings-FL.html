<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
