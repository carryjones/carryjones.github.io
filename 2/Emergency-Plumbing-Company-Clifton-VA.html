<p>A lot of disposals will last between 10 and 12 years prior to requiring replacement. Indications that your disposal requires to be replaced include needing to press the reset button frequently, the blades no longer chopping up the waste well or taking longer to chop up the waste, leaking from the bottom of the unit, regular clogs, or visible rust on the unit itself.</p>
