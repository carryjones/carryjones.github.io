<p>Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
