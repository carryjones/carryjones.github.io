A lot of homes in the United States, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets likewise have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.  This seal weakens with time permitting water to escape into the toilet bowl, thus minimizing the quantity of water in the tank readily available for a flush.  It likewise has the drawback of increasing your water expense due to waste of water.</p>
<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't set up correctly, you may experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
