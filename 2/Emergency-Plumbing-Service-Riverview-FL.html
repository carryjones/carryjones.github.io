<p>All exposed water lines are checked for leaks or damage. Every Costs Howe plumber has a standard Badger 5 disposal on his truck at all times.

<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections relating to the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water system into the public water system.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can achieve this.</p>
