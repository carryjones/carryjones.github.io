<p>Reach for a common household plunger if these combinations aren't successful in unclogging your sink. Very first seal off the second side with a damp fabric or a stopper if you have a double sink. You'll need to produce a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with adequate water to cover the bell of the plunger.

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
