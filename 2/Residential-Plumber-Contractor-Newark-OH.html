<p>Because of the inherent design of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on a very low flow or static circulation condition might trigger annoyance leaking and prospective fouling of the assembly.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for residents.

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to get rid of.</p>
