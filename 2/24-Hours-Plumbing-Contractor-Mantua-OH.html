Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older areas where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as compounded if pipes have been allowed to freeze.</p>

<p>Noticeable odor. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or service place, provide us a call. That odor might be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your home, launches sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will frequently need to be changed rather than repaired. You'll know this if your pipes are gurgling or releasing foul odors.</p>
<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
