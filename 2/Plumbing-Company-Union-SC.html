When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Present regulations limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.

If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
