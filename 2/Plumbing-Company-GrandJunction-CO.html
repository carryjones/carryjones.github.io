<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at GrandJunction CO</h3>
<p>When your water heater starts to leak, you have to replace it fast. We'll show you how to install your own gas hot water heater in less than a day. Even if you do not need a brand-new hot water heater today, possibilities are you will within the next couple of years. Hot water heater tend to last seven to 15 years. This article is also for you if yours is getting old. If you're useful with standard tools and have a bit of experience soldering copper, replacing a water heater isn't challenging.</p>
<p>Whatever the case might be, take preventive action by permitting our gas plumbers to perform annual gas inspections and other necessary gas line replacement, repair, and installation projects. Bear in mind gas leakages can be unexpected. That is why Stephens Plumbing uses know-how gas line repairs at a minute's notice, keeping you safe and secure and safe. We also offer other emergency repair and installation services such as drain cleaning, hot water heater repair, water line installation, backflow testing, commercial plumbing repair, house plumbing, toilet repair, and f ixture installation services.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last couple of years. A great guideline for water heaters is this: since the life expectancy of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is majority the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
