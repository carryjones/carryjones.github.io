<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are many factors that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of rust control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
