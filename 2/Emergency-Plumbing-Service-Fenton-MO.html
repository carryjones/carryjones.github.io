<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
