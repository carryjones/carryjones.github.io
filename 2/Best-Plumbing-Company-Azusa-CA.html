<p>Tru-Soft ® Solar Salt water Blocks are produced for the requirements of numerous water softener units. Current Review: Howard, the Task Supervisor, has always been useful and handy concerning all our concerns. He did the proposition and scheduled the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair without delay. It is constantly a pleasure to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is constantly pleasant, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener. Normally, this is since the system is outdated or not working effectively. Whatever the factor, you can be missing out on the benefits of soft water without even knowing it.</p>
