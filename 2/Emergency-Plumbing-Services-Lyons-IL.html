<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
