<p>There are a couple of indicators that will let you understand you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is important to pay attention to them. If you see a strong smell that looks like rotten eggs, then the gas pipe might be pierced or harmed. You might likewise hear a hissing sound as the gas is leaving from the line, but that isn't always the case. It is important to take action rapidly to avoid any major problems and to keep everyone safe if you smell rotten eggs.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
