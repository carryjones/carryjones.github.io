<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic equipment.

Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
