To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market.

The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
