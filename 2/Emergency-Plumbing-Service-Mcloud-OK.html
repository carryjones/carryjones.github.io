The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow.
