<p>Nevertheless, UPC design code needs stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping materials to achieve the same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are added to a fire protection system provided by a potable water supply, increased defense is also required. If you have kids, advise them to prevent hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
