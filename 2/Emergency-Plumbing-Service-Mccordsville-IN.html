These pipes are mainly in manufacturing, commercial, and commercial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, along with heating and cooling systems in big office buildings. Steamfitters focus on systems that are created for the flow of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
