<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
