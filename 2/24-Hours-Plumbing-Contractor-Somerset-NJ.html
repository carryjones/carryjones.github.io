<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.
