<p>Frequent leaks: Leaks originating from your water heater are never an excellent indication. If your water heater has frequent leakages or is constantly requiring repairs, it is likely more cost-efficient to replace the entire unit.

Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away.

As the outer finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
