<h3>Blocked Drains in Carrboro NC - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are many elements that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of deterioration control. Thus, thinking about all these elements, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
