<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to supplying a comprehensive line of backflow preventers, the majority of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing components satisfy and go beyond the requirements developed by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free initiative. Current modifications to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are directly planned for human water consumption are required to be made with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass content. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this classification have actually been designated lead-free," suggesting they are certified.</p>
<p>When selecting the correct system defense there are numerous factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a private basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the danger that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to fulfill that specific risk or need. An airplane garage will need a very various fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also differ considerably.</p>
