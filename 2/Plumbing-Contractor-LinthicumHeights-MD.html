A common water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Fixing a leaky faucet appears like a simple job, but often times the scenario can be stealthily complicated. In some cases it's best to call in a certified plumber to make certain the root cause of the leak is effectively identified and attended to the first time, rather than making a number of trips to the hardware store and purchasing a variety of parts just to end up exactly where you began, or even worse, developing an even bigger mess.
