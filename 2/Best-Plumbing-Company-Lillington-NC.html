<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- typically sodium. The result is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that constitute difficult water.</p>

<p>And so, we see the shift from huge transportation pipelines (aqueducts) supplying water to entire cities to large circulation pipes (mains) servicing smaller communities or large centers, to medium distribution pipelines and lastly to small service pipelines. Each stage in the water supply and distribution system has to deal with differing flow rates, flow speeds and pressure heads, along with different levels of exposure to prospective backwash or pollutant seepage and the subsequent need for protection with backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>

<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Lillington NC</h3>
<p>In most cases, the toilet can be fixed rather than changed, considering that the problem frequently boils down to a single element or more. In some cases, however, the damage is so comprehensive that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is simply a more useful alternative. This normally involves fractures in the toilet bowl itself, widespread rust over multiple elements, or just because you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>There are numerous signs to watch out for. 1) The surface of the floor in one area is warm or even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all appliances and components in your house have actually been switched off. 3) The water heater seems to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to higher gas and water expenses, in some cases really rapidly.</p>
