<h3>Water Heaters & Water Filtering in Eureka Missouri</h2>
<p>In many cases, our service technicians will recommend that you replace your hot water heater rather than invest in repairs. This is typically When the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of an entire new system, the case. Sometimes a frustrating toilet just requires a minor change and life is back to regular.

<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Eureka MO</h3>
<p>For the most part, the toilet can be repaired rather than replaced, given that the issue frequently comes down to a single component or 2. Sometimes, however, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is just a more practical alternative. This usually involves cracks in the toilet bowl itself, widespread deterioration over numerous parts, or just because you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
