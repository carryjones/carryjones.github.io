<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the newly cleaned up main drain.
