As soon as this happens it will cause a reduction in the water pressure and also drastically decreases the life expectancy of all household devices. Water leaks: If you notice a leak in your pipes, there might be other leaks you are uninformed of. Leakages are a sure sign that your pipes are used and old and need to be replaced.

<p>Inspect the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust only in your hot water. You may need a professional to do this if you have actually never done this on your own. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is probably coming from the inside of your hot water heater. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you probably have worn away piping.</p>
