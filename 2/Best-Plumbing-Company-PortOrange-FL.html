<p>In many cases, our professionals will advise that you replace your hot water heater instead of purchase repairs. This is typically the case when the hot water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of a whole new unit. Sometimes a problematic toilet just requires a small adjustment and life is back to typical. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a color test.</p>

If not, Apollo House's skilled and licensed plumbers will do what it takes to get your garbage disposal boning up again or install a new one, frequently on the exact same day.
