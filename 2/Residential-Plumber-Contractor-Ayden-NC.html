<p>He dug two holes on either side of the pipe and was able to blast the old, broken pipe out while changing it with a new one at the exact same time. We did a follow-up call to the house owner numerous weeks later, and she reported no excess water in her lawn. Job well done: You do not want to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the task to a qualified plumber makes sure a smooth installation procedure.</p>

The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm guarantee that the unique feature will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration.

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your whole home when you find a leak.</p>
