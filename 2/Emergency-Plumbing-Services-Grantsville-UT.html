<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
