<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair FloralPark NY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
