<p>Repiping is not a short-lived fix. It's a long-term option for the entire plumbing system in your house or business. We shut off the supply of water, remove old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the new system is set up, we turn the water on and perform tests on the brand-new system. When the system passes our tests, it's good to choose you.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
