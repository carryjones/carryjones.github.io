<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Delphi IN?</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
