Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
