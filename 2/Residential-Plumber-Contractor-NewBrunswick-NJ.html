If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>

If you live in an older home, your sink might not have one, requiring you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to unexpectedly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding stop. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot.
