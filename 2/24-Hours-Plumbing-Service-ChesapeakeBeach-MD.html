<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply exceeds the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the make-up water. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible pollutants can then enter the safe and clean water system. The best method to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
