Turn on the gas and examine connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
