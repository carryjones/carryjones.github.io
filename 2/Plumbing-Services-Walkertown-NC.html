Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system.

<p>If your hot water heater has actually required multiple repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it replaced. A good guideline for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the lifespan of the typical hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is known as fouling. Sometimes it might be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Cleaners need to be used according to maker guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
