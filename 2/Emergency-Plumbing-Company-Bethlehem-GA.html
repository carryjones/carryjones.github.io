<p>Garbage disposals are a vital feature in any modern kitchen. If you reside in an older home, your sink might not have one, forcing you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to unexpectedly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding stop. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per linear foot. Copper pipes are eco-friendly and are resistant to breaking. However, they're also the most expensive in this list and in locations with difficult water (like Florida) they can develop pinhole leakages.</p>
