<p>After arriving after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take duty if it leaked now since of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
