<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
