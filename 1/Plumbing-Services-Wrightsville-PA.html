<p>Every day, the drains in your house efficiently get rid of big amounts of water and waste. Gradually, dirt, particles, hair, and countless other small particles can get caught and develop in your pipes. Eventually, the water might not have the ability to drain rapidly or efficiently, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up.

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, along with examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
