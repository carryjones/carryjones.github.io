<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. It is necessary that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be tested periodically to ensure they are operating properly. A visual check of air spaces is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers need to be checked with correctly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
