<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey choice.</p>
