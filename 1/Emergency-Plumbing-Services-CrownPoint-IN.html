<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion describes what happens when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens due to the fact that the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can trigger clogs, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to extensive residential or commercial property damage. Look out for wet, green spots in your backyard, a consistent sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all typical indications of root intrusion.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
