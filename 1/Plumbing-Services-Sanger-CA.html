<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is a vital kitchen appliance in a lot of homes today. While most kitchen sink disposers can deal with almost any type of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inadequate, increasing the risk of drain blockages.</p>
