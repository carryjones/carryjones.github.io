To avoid deterioration from rust, tank are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting harmful materials. By having the anode rod checked routinely and changed as required, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>Water solidity is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
