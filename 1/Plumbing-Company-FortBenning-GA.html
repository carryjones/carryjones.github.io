<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP garbage disposal unit can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is extremely little insulation in the weaker designs. Here are some common types of garbage disposals you might want to consider. There are generally two types of disposals: aluminum and stainless steel. Aluminum disposals are the most economical, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are prone to rust and leaking.</p>
<p>At the top of the old disposer, put a screwdriver or the wrenchette" into the right side of one of the lugs in the mounting ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, rotate the mounting ring counterclockwise to release the disposal. Be aware that the disposal might consist of water and food waste, so bring it outside right-side up.</p>
<p>Other signs you may need to repipe consist of rust in your supply of water, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily indicate repiping is the only solution. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the problem to figure out the best strategy.</p>
