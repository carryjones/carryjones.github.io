<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous desired usages around your home.</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will eventually take its toll. If you discover that your plumbing struggles with various obstructions, leakages, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs seems to stem, you should seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option. Homeowners ought to inspect water pressure entering into their home on a routine basis. Water pressure should have to do with 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can can be found in at over 100 PSI.</p>
