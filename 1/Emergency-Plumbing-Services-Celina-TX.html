<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
