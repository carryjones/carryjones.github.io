<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of factors, consisting of bad soil conditions, obstructions from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older areas where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as intensified if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>However, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping products to accomplish the same level of protection as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire defense system provided by a potable water supply, increased security is likewise needed. Advise them to prevent hanging on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have kids. Hanging on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
