We offer two kinds of water treatment systems for tough water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for purposes of getting rid of bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are certainly top priorities for a town and its citizens however hard water can adversely affect faucets and devices in a home.
