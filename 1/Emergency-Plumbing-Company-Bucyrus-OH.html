<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
