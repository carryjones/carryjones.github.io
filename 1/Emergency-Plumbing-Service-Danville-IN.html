<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Danville IN</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
