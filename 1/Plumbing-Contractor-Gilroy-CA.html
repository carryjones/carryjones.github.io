<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cable connected. If this holds true, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1). Make sure to acquire an electrical wiring kit with the correct power ranking and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord when you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regeneration depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water in fact requires it. More recent units use digital sensors that keep an eye on bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and for that reason only regrow when needed. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal because they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
