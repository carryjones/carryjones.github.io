You can unwind and use your gas piping without any worry when we handle your gas or propane pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's likewise an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Worn-out pipes when you need to replace old. Repiping a house can take from a couple of hours for a simplistic minor pipe repair or replacement, or it can use up to a week for larger homes needing the entire plumbing system repiped. It actually depends upon the amount of work you need done, the size of your home and how many contractors are dealing with your home.</p>

<p>Regular professional maintenance is crucial to preventing hot water heater problems. Your hot water heater ought to be inspected by a professional a minimum of once a year.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was plainly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
