<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
