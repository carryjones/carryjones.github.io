When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is broken. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed gradually. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth processes.
