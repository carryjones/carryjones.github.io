<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in PalmSprings CA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
