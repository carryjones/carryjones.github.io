If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet.

After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed.
