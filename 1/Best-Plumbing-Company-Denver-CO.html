This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure.

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be constantly kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
