<p>The majority of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the external covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
