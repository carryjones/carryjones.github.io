<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Pottstown PA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be constantly kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
