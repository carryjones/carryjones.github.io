<p>This is among the very first and main concerns that you should ask yourself when it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house. The age of your house is an important part to comprehend whether you should repipe your home.

If your home was constructed prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was constructed decades before that, possibilities are that your house might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates.</p>
<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the property or apartment board. Owners and boards of buildings that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit strategies with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has actually not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Violation will be sent. Lawbreakers will be liable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
