<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
