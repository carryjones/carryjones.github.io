<p>After arriving after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they would not take duty if it dripped now due to the fact that of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never want to see this company again.</p>

For instance, California has stringent guidelines relating to underground gas line installation because of earthquakes and other natural catastrophes.
