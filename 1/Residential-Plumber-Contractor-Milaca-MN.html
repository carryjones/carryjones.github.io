<p>With the severity of plumbing problems being equal, you might be much better off changing your toilet if it is an older model. Older toilets often abide by more lax guidelines in terms of water usage, so a more recent toilet might end up conserving you money monthly. Nevertheless, some plumbing systems work best with older toilets. Consult an expert at Metcalf Plumbing to see if you need toilet repair or replacement, especially if you have actually cast iron plumbing.</p>
