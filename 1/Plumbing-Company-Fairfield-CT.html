<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
