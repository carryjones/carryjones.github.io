<p>There are a couple of kinds of water heaters to pick from, each design has its downsides and advantages. The very best one for you depends on just how much hot water you use, and the heating technique (electricity, gas, oil). Some claim to lower energy costs by approximately half of standard storage models. The compromise is that the initial costs are higher and your roi will take longer.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
