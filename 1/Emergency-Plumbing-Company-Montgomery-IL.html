<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals expect to see however hardly ever stop to think about. 106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exemptions in Area 106.2.2 will apply to minor repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings other than Group R-3 occupancies, a permit and inspection shall be required for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor level, wing, or area is involved, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (nominal) of the total structure plumbing.</p>
<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
