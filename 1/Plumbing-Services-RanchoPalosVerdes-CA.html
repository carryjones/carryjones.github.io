The problem might spread out significantly if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and infecting the general public water supply.</p>

Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
