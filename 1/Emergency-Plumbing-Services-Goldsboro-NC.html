Although tough water is normally safe to use, it can trigger a variety of problems associated with cleaning, device life expectancy and effectiveness. At EcoWater, we have what we believe is the best water softening system warranty on the marketplace to help you win the battle against hard water.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these little deposits are harmless, however over time they develop and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
