<p>The next action we should perform in the repair process, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to ensure the line is properly flushed.</p>
