A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to use salt pellets in the salt water tank, however then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will remove salt from the water, which you can utilize for drinking and cooking.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in areas where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
