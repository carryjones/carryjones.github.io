I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
