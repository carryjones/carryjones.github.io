Your water heater must be flushed once a year. If you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never ever been flushed, it may have up to eight inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank. That means 8 less inches of warm water, not to point out the truth that your tap water is being heated up in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling bacteria.</p>
