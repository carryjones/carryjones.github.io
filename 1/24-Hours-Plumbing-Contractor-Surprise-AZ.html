<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cord connected. If this is the case, get rid of the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1). Be sure to buy a wiring package with the appropriate power rating and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord.</p>

Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale considerably reduces the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice machines.
