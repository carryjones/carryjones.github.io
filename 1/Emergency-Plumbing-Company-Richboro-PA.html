Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both.

<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
