Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
