<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were really responsive and prompt to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome task. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration just appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still a problem that requires to be handled right away (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>

<p>Most houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
