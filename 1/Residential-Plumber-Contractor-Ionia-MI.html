<p>Daily usage ought to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a safe and steady  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you must wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that examined the system for fractures or broken fittings.

As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to five months after occupancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
