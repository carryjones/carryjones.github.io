When dealing with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps apply additional pressure to the clog. For clogs that occur even more down the pipe, utilize a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, flexible steel cable injury around a spool with a hand crank.
