This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with safe and clean water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
