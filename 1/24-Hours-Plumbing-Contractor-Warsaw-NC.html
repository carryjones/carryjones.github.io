<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Does it appear like your drains are constantly slow or clogged? Often, this is caused by built-up sediment and other products that are triggering a clog in your sewer drain.

<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
