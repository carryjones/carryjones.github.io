<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Columbia SC</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>2 designs of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB may be used to separate health or non-health hazards but is effective versus back-siphonage just.</p>

<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the standard plumber's putty as described below. Both will produce a great seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
