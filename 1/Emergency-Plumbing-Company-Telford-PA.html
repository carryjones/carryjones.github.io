<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a range of factors, including bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and rust. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have actually been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
