<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on wet or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a threat of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen.

<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean.

Regeneration automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
