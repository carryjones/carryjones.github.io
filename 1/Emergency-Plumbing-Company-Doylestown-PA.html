<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into television, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and deterioration. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
