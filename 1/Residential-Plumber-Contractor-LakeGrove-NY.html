<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
