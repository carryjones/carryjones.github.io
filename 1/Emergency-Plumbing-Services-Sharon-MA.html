<p>Backflow preventers ought to just be repaired when the data collected from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the established minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
