<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller design that ran on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can buy designs with special features that do everything but include the salt, you will pay for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the special function will not stop working. Depending upon the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you ought to think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This may or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
