<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe in Markham IL</h3>
<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of corrosion control. Thus, considering all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
