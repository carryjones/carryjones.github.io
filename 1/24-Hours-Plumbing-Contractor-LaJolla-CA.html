<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. An action team is available for preliminary examination of sewer emergencies every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks. City employees will examine and eliminate clogs in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is responsible for.

<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you observe that your plumbing struggles with various obstructions, leakages, and water pressure fluctuation that no quantity of repairs seems to stem, you ought to seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service. House owners ought to check water pressure coming into their house on a regular basis. Water pressure should be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can be available in at over 100 PSI.</p>

I would fix a limit at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specific designs). Their installation should be dealt with by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
<p>Other indications you may need to repipe consist of rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail indications that precede repiping services, they do not always imply repiping is the only solution. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the issue to figure out the very best strategy.</p>
