<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time associated. If everything is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the total expenses. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
