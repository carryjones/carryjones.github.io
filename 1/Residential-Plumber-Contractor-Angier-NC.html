<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Angier NC</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
