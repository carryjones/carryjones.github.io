To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures.
