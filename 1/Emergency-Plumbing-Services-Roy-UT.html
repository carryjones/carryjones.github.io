<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
