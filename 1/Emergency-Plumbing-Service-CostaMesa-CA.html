<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Service in CostaMesa</h2>

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
