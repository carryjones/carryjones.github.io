<p>Backflow is dangerous because it can contaminate the public drinking supply with pollutants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals. In 2010, for instance, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky elementary school suffered queasiness and other signs after a contractor dealing with the A/C system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health risk if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
<p>Backpressure might happen when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be required into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not correctly safeguarded.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear space will be preserved above the assembly to enable servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves. As quickly as you believe a problem with your sewer or water lines, call a plumber. An obstruction or a break can result in damages that are expensive to repair so time is of the essence. Our professionally-trained, background-checked, and licensed plumbers will gladly answer any questions you have about your house's plumbing system.</p>
