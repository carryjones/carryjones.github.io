<p>. Backflow into a public water system can contaminate or infect the water because system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system unusable or risky to consume), and each water provider has a duty to offer water that is functional and safe to drink under all foreseeable scenarios. Additionally, customers normally have outright faith that water provided to them through a public water supply is always safe to consume. For these reasons, your water district should take precautions to secure its public water system against backflow.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to supply some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
