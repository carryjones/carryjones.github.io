<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
