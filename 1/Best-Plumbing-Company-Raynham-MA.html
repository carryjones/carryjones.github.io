<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
