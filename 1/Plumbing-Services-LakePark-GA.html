<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is comprised of numerous mechanical parts which, with time, go through wear and tear and may need to be replaced.

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
