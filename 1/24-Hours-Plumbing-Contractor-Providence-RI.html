<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
