<p>Covert water leakages are often difficult and have Possibly Serious Effects. Changing your flapper may need a little various actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.)

If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
