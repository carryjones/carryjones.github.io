Backflow into a public water system can contaminate or contaminate the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system risky or unusable to consume), and each water supplier has a responsibility to supply water that is functional and safe to drink under all foreseeable situations. In addition, customers typically have outright faith that water delivered to them through a public water supply is always safe to drink. For these factors, your water district need to take preventative measures to secure its public water supply versus backflow.</p>
