This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
