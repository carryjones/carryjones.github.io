<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see however rarely stop to consider. 106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exemptions in Area 106.2.2 shall apply to minor repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings other than Group R-3 tenancies, a permit and inspection shall be needed for more extensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor wing, area, or level is involved, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (nominal) of the total structure plumbing.</p>

Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
