<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
