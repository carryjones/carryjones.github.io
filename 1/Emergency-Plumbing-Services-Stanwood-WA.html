<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many designated uses around your house.</p>
