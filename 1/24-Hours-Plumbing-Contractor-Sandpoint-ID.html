You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

Many faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout.

Adding air in this way maintains constant water pressure, which triggers the fixture to use less water.</p>
