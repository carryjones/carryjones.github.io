<p>If your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it changed. A great general rule for water heaters is this: since the lifespan of the typical water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Conventional tank-type hot water heater include steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large storage tank. The water inside this tank is heated up and then launched into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature level and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you surpass a preset level. You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperature levels and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
