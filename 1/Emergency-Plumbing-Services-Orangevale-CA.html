<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
