<p>Lots of plumbing concerns involve stoppages and clogged drains or pipes. If all of your DIY efforts don't work, blockages in the sink, bathtub, shower and toilets may be covered by an American Home Guard plumbing warranty depending on the cause.

<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and rust. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
