<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Lockhart TX</h3>
<p>We have a plumbing service if you have a toilet issue. Considering that 1992, our toilet repair and installation professionals have served the neighborhoods of Palmdale, Lancaster, and the surrounding locations and developed enduring relationships with clients based upon superior client service. We have years of experience in installing and repairing toilets, and we  wish to stick around for another few years assisting people like you and your family.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>House remodeling or house restorations are the perfect time to replace your home's pipes. However, if your home is built on a raised foundation then replacing the pipes can likewise be finished with minimal damage. Residences built on a slab structure can gain from having their pipes replaced though the amount of drywall patching and painting is typically higher.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
