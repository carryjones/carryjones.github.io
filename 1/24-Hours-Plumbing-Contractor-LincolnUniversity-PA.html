<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
