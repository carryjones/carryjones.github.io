<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a system, fixture, or sub-system  group is changed, a permit and inspection will not be required.

<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
