<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can attain this.</p>
