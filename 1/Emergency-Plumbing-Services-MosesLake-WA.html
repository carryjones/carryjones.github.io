<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
