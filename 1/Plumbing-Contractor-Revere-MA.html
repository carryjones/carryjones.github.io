<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Revere MA</h3>

Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these problems.</p>
