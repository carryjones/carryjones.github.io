<p>Our professional, Tom, was exceptional. He was extensive, thoughtful, explained the work to be done, the cost, alternatives, and appeared to take the minimum amount of time to complete the work.

This is normally When the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of an entire new system, the case. Sometimes a frustrating toilet just requires a minor adjustment and life is back to normal. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a dye test.</p>
<p>This is the timeless concern that lots of homeowners ask themselves. Is it better to repair their pipes or repipe them and start fresh? The answer is totally based on your unique situation. For instance, if your pipe is experiencing a little leak but remains in otherwise excellent condition, we would suggest repairing it. However, if the pipe is constantly leaking and requires regular repairs, we would recommend repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never ever suggest products or services that would not genuinely benefit the client.</p>
