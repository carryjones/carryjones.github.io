<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed against it will result in decapitation, it might scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
