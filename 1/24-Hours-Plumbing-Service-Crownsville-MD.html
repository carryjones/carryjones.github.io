<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>
