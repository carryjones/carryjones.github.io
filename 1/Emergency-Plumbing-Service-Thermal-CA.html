<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain correctly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. Sometimes drain repair needs can be solved reasonably rapidly by a skilled handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be dismantled, examined, and cleared before being replaced.

<p>Repairs are too expensive. If your commode requires several repairs, it's a better use of your money to acquire a brand new one.

<p>We're replacing a gas water heater in our demonstration. The actions for replacing a gas water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. Repeating repairs and leaks. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we recommend changing your system if it is over ten years old.</p>
<p>Read your insurance coverage policy completely if your polybutylene pipes have failed. Make sure you know what is covered and what is not covered. Numerous insurance companies will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be denied due to the fact that the standard HO-3 house owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged time period." Call your insurance coverage agent and verify your protection. As soon as you have gone through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to verify that your understanding is proper.</p>
<p>If you  want to remove the salt, simply fill the brine tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only problem is that potassium chloride is costly: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Many high-pressure water jetters will operate with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
