<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
