An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
