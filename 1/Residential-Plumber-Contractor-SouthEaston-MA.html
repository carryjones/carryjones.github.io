<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does occur more often than you believe! Frequently it occurs during the night when you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
