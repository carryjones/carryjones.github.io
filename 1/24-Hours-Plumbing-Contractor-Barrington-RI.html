Claims may be denied due to the fact that the basic HO-3 property owners' policy specifically excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged time period."

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
