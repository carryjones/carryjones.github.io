If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just safeguard against back siphonage.</p>
