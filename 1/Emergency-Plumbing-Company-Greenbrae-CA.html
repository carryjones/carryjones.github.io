<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Greenbrae CA</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hang on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by hanging on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As hard water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Since the hardness minerals have a greater favorable charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their location.</p>

After they gave me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.
