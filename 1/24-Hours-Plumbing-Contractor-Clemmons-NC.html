Before going into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to understand how a toilet works.  Most houses in the United States, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is described as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets likewise have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the tank that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.  This seal degrades over time permitting water to get away into the toilet bowl, therefore reducing the amount of water in the tank available for a flush.

A water softener addresses among the most common and destructive water problems: tough water.  Difficult water damaged the modern home.

Scale dramatically shortens the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice machines. Hard water damages warm water home appliances.

However where backflow preventers are most necessary is in the supply of drinkable water for personal and domestic use.</p>

If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
