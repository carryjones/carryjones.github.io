I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
