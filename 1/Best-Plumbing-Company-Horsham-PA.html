<p>This is an entirely valid concern that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, of course, as important as your water heater, water line, or drains. Nevertheless, it includes a fair quantity of performance to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably little round device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
