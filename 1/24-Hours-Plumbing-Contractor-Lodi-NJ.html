<p>A gas line installation will bring new chance to your house in terms of heating and energy. Green World Plumbing & Sewer is here to assist if you need gas lines set up at your house or are looking into a re-pipe for your existing plumbing system. The purpose of a repair on a backflow preventer is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. The need for a repair can only be identified by conducting a field test on the assembly and understanding when the information shows the backflow prevention assembly is in need of repair.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
