These leakages are exceptionally wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>

More recent models just use 1.6 gallons per flush while still supplying the very same flushing power. More recent toilet styles are environmentally-friendly and have a dual flushing system which just utilizes 0.9 gallons per flush.
