<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
