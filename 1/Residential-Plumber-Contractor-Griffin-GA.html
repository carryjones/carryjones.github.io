<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller sized model that operated on the exact same principle however could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
<p>The system has gone back to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris in between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is avoiding the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This permits pressure to equalize between the Supply Side and the Zone of Reduced Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
