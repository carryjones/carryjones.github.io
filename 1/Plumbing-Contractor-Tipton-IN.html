<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
