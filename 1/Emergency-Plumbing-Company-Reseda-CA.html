It may seem virtually impossible to keep track of such a deeply underground system. Maintenance, on an underground system, may appear null and void when your plumbing is over forty years of ages.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line.

<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
