When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system.

In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
