<p>To avoid these things from obstructing your drains and triggering damage, Larry & Sons suggests that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These cool additions to your sinks and tubs can lower the amount of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drainpipes. Lots of garbage disposals will require a new sink drain flange, which includes the metal disk at the drain entryway at the bottom of the sink in addition to a brief length of pipe that extends below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
<p>At least once every three months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon or so assists get rid of the sediment. If you find a leak and go with a patching job instead of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the exact same material and they might be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your entire home when you spot a leak.</p>
