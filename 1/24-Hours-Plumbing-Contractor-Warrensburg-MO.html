<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>

<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Warrensburg MO</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

The kitchen sink drain may need a simple tightening up or a replacement. You will see the evident spray if the leak is in the pressurized hose spray.
