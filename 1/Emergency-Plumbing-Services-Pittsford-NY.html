<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Pittsford NY</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of deterioration control. Hence, considering all these factors, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
