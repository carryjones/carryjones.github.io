<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is likewise acts as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Examiner for the group. There are few instances when plumbing inspections are mandatory, but the biggest exceptions are construction and house updates.

<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
