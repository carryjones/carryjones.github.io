<p>All Backflow Prevention Assembly Testers (BAPTs) are needed to register with Vepo, LLC.

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
