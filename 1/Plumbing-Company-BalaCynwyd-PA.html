<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services BalaCynwyd PA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
