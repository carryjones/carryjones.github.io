Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would give a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation before committing to a price, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
