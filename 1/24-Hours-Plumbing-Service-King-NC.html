<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
<p>GGP is always prepared to repair any of these types of sinks. Must you experience a specialized faucet repair that requires unique order parts, we can position the order and get the sink fixed as quickly as the part shows up.
