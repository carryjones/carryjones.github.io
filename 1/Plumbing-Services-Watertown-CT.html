<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Watertown CT</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
