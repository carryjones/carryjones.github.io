Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
