<p>Wood pipes were used in London and somewhere else during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
