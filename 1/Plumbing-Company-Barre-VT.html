I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
