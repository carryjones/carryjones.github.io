Before going into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to comprehend how a toilet works.  The majority of houses in the US, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets likewise have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.  This seal degrades with time enabling water to leave into the toilet bowl, therefore minimizing the quantity of water in the tank readily available for a flush.  It likewise has the drawback of increasing your water costs due to wastage of water.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent.
