Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water in fact needs it. More recent systems use digital sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other crucial metrics based upon your water use and for that reason just regrow when needed. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal since they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
