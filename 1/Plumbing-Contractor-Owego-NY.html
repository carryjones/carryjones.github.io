<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the splendor in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge between guy and machine.

And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, ensuring your trip lever is working well can conserve you the trouble of those little daily troubles - that the majority of people just deal with and never ever recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>
