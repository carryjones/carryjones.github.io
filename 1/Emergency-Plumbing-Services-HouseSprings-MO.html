If your house was developed prior to the 1970s, we highly recommend that you hire a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your home might need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at ideal rates if your house was built years before that.</p>
<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint.
