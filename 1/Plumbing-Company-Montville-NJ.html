<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) provide certification courses designed to train professionals to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
