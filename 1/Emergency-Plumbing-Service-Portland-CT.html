<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically 2 layers of defense. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong method. There are two different types of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are frequently specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device.
