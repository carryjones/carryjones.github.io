<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Woodbury NJ</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
