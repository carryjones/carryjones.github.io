If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience obstructions in several drains at the same time in your house, then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in numerous areas and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your house.</p>
