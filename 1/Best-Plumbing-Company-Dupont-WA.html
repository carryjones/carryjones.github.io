Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our clients is kept devoid of harmful contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices containing a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the potable water supply. This can take place through a procedure called backflow.</p>
<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer will be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices advises a DCV assembly on damp or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a threat of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, in addition to inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
