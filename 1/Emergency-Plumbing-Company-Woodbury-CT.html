<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Woodbury CT</h3>

For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of rust control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
