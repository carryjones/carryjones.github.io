<p>Backflow is dangerous due to the fact that it can contaminate the public drinking supply with pollutants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals.

<p>Similar to other building employees, work of pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers is sensitive to changes in the economy.
