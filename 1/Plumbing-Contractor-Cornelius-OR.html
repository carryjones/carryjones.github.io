Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
