<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Cary NC</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
