<p>Install really affordable low-flow aerators for bathroom and kitchen faucets. Whole home filtration systems can get rid of chlorine and other hazardous chemicals from all of your water sources and enhance your water taste, quality, and color for drinking, bathing, cleaning, and washing.

<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is referred to as fouling. Sometimes it may be essential to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin ends up being fouled. Cleaners need to be utilized according to manufacturer instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
