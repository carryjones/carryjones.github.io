<p>The toilet takes a truly long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout regular operation, the pressure in between the two check valves-- described as the zone of reduced pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside, making sure backflow never takes place.</p>

The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm assurance that the unique feature will not fail. Depending upon the water source, you may need to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit.
