<p>The most reliable way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>However, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to achieve the exact same level of protection as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire protection system supplied by a drinkable water supply, increased defense is also needed.

Holding on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter need to be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
