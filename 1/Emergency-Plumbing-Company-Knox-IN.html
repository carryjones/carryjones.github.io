<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
