<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Photo 1. Water is likely leaving through a split or rusted overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running sound. In that case, you have to remove the tank from the bowl and replace the entire flush valve. Considering that the overflow tube is seldom the reason for a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is known as fouling. Often it may be necessary to filter the water prior to it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
