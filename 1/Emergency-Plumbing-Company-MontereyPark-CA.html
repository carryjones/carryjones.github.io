<p>Everyday usage need to not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a stable and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you need to wait till after the cycle is completed and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must also inspect to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
