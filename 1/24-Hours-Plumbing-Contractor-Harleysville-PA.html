To make it soft, you have to remove the minerals. That's the main distinction between soft and tough water The existence of the minerals in the water can reveal itself in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>The drains in the average home get consistent usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other particles can slowly build up with time. The drain will slowly slow until it becomes entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in stores have limited effectiveness. Although the drain might appear to clear initially, the result is frequently short-term and the clog quickly returns. Using these chemicals often can trigger damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
