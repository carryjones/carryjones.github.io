For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally sodium. The result is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
