<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
