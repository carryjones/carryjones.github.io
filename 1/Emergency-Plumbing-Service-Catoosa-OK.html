<p>The main media contained within a water softener is called ion exchange resin. This resin is essentially an insoluble matrix typically in the shape of small (1-2 mm size) beads. The product has extremely developed structure of pores on the surface area of which are sites with easily trapped and launched ions. This process of trapping of ions happens with a synchronised releasing of other ions leading to the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be produced to selectively choose one, or possibly several various types of ions. Generally, these resins are based upon cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
