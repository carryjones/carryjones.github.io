<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
