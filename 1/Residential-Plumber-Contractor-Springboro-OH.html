No matter what type of water heater you have or have an interest in, the specialists at Timothy Off can assist. Contact us today for our hot water heater installation services. For instance, if your kitchen sink is backed up due to the fact that you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a fast drain snaking can break up the blockage and send it down the pipes.

Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
