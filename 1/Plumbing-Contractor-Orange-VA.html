One typical way for a home's water system to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread exponentially if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in private residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>
