<p>If these mixes aren't successful in unclogging your sink, grab a common household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal off the 2nd side with a damp fabric or a stopper. You'll need to produce a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you mean to plunge with enough water to cover the bell of the plunger. Location the plunger securely over the drain and plunge vigorously a number of times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, get rid of the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water.</p>
<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not recommended, as this might clog the softening tank.

And make sure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
