Prolonged service warranty: Many disposals feature a minimum of a 1-year guarantee, however if you purchase one with a life time service warranty (15+ years), it will probably be more expensive. While there's not a specific timetable regarding when you ought to repipe your house, you should definitely check out repiping if they haven't been carried out in 50 years or more-- particularly if you live in an older house developed closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your system is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- make sure your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the new system in. While it's not likely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed against it will cause decapitation, it may scare a couple of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
