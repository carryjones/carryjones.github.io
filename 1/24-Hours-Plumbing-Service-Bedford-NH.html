<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
