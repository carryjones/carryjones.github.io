Here's how it works: During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of lowered pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to release and open water to the outdoors, ensuring backflow never occurs.</p>
